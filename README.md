# Downtify (for Windows)

Downtify rerecords songs or playlists from Spotify, and saves it to your PC.
The program skips ads and downloads the tags of the recorded song.

## Getting Started 

### Installing And Deployment

* Copy the program's content into a new directory.

* Build the project.

### Downtify Requirements  

* A Spotify client should be installed on your computer ([Spotify for Windows](https://www.spotify.com/il/download/windows/)).
* You must logged in to your Spotify account (free or premium).

Now the program can be used.
