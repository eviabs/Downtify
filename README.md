# IMPORTANT NOTE #
**This project is no longer maintained and doesn't work at the moment.**

Some major api changes were made on Spotify's side, and Downtify must be rewritten in order to work again.

Currently I'm still maintaining [downtify-premium](https://github.com/eviabs/downtify-premium).

# Downtify (for Windows)

Downtify rerecords songs or playlists from Spotify, and saves them to your PC.

The program skips ads and downloads the tags of the recorded songs.

## Getting Started 

### Installing And Deployment

* Copy the program's content into a new directory.

* Build the project.

### Downtify Requirements  

* A Spotify client should be installed on your computer ([Spotify for Windows](https://www.spotify.com/il/download/windows/)).
* You must be logged-in to your Spotify account (free or premium).

Now the program can be used.
